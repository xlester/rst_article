\begin{abstract}
  Iterative Least-Squares (ILS) algorithms are used when having a
  Phase-Shifting Interferogram (PSI) sequence where we do not know the
  inter-frame phase-shifts and these are not necessary
  constant. Basically, ILS algorithms uses the PSI least-squares model
  in two main steps: 1) Estimate the modulating phase with a set of
  guessed phase-shifts, and 2) Estimate the phase-shifts using the
  previously estimated phase. These two steps are performed
  iteratively. In this class of algorithms, a source of error is when
  is estimating the phase-shifts while the background illimination
  varies spatially. This is because the least-squares model assumes
  constat background illumination. To improve this, in this paper we
  divede in subregions the interferogram frames and apply the
  least-squares model on each subregion. Thus, each subregion may have
  its own background illimination, being less restrictive than
  applying the least-squares model to the global frame. The numerical
  experiments presented here, show that this approach enhance the
  obtained results of the well known published ILS algorithms. For
  demonstration purposes, the source code of this algorithm is provided
  in the references for download.

\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI) techniques are some of
the most used techniques in optical metrology
\cite{a1_OpticalTesting}. In PSI, one obtains a small sequence of at
least 3 interferograms with a phase-shift among them
\cite{a1_OpticalTesting}. To recover the modulating phase, there are
standard demodulation PSI methods, the well known 3-, 4-, and 5- step
phase-shifting algorithms.  Knowing the inter-frame phase-shifts (or
temporal carrier), the standard methods recover the 2$\pi$ modulus
phase map with the minimum possible error
\cite{a1_OpticalTesting,a2_F&K,a3}. If we do not know the phase-shifts
exactly, we obtain a phase map with an unavoidable detuning error
whose magnitude depends on the number of interferograms employed and
on how far we are from the actual phase-shifts
\cite{a3,a4,a5,a6}. This unfortunate case can occur when the optical
interferometer setup is uncalibrated or when perturbations from the
environment affect the interferometer's optical path. For example, for
most phase shifters, such as a piezoelectric (PZT), there is a
repeatability problem arising from hysteresis, non linearity and
temperature linear drift \cite{a5,a7}; curiously, the first
phase-shifting algorithms were self-tuning nonlinear algorithms
\cite{a8,a9}. To reduce detuning errors, other approaches propose
error compensating algorithms that basically use redundant data, such
as the Schwider- Hariharan 5- step algorithm \cite{a4,a10,a11}, and
more recently, the 9-step algorithm shown in Ref. \cite{a12} has been
used to do it by constructing a wide-band frequency response of the
phase-shifting algorithm. Further methods use the Fourier transform in
order to estimate the inter-frame phase-shifts, and others are based
on the least-squares scheme, iteratively estimating the inter-frame
phase-shifts and phase \cite{a13,a14}.  Ref. \cite{a16} presentes an
approach that estimates the local temporal carrier (the phase-shift)
as the average of the phase difference between two consecutive phase
maps obtained from two realizations of the tunable 3-step
algorithm. What we are going to show in this work is a regularized
self-tuning demodulation technique that obtains the analytical image
(complex interferogram) and inter-frame phase-shifts from an
interferogram sequence. Thus, we can recover the modulating phase
2$\pi$ modulus and the inter-frame phase shifts in the same
process. Here, it is not necessary to know the inter-frame
phase-shifts. These inter-frame phase-shifts can vary arbitrarily.

The main difference between the demodulation method presented here and
the ones reported in \cite{a14},\cite{a15} and \cite{a17} is that our
demodulation method is based on a regularization technique that is
robust to non-constant modulation variations and non-constant
background illumination, which is an issue that introduces errors in
the methods in works \cite{a14} and \cite{a15}. Besides, we do not
require to estimate the fringe orientation, as the method in work
\cite{a17}.

\section{Method}

In general, an interferogram sequence with arbitrary inter-frame
phase-shifts can be modeled as:
\begin{equation}\label{I_k1}
  I_{x,y}^k=a_{x,y}+b_{x,y}cos(\phi_{x,y}+\alpha_k),\: k=0,1,2,...,L-1,
\end{equation}
where $I_{x,y}^k$ is the intensity at the site $x,y$ of the
$k$-interferogram in a sequence of $L-1$ interferograms, being
$a_{x,y}$ its background illumination, $b_{x,y}$ its contrast,
$\phi_{x,y}$ the modulating phase under test and $\alpha_k$ the
phase-shift of the $k$-interferogram.

\subsection{Least-squares method}

As we can see from Eq. (\ref{I_k1}), conventional phase-shifting
algorithms assume that the background illumination and the modulation
amplitude do not have frame-to-frame variation; i.e., they are
functions of pixels only. Defining a new set of variables as
$\varphi_{x,y}=b_{x,y}cos(\phi_{x,y})$,
$\psi_{x,y}=b_{x,y}sin(\phi_{x,y})$, $C_k=cos(\alpha_k)$,
$S_k=sin(\alpha_k)$, we can express Eq. (\ref{I_k1}) as
\begin{equation}\label{I_k2}
  I_{x,y}^k=a_{x,y}+\varphi_{x,y}C_k-\psi_{x,y}S_k,\: k=0,1,2,...,L-1.
\end{equation}
If we know $\alpha_k$, there are $3MN$ unknowns (where $M$ and $N$ are
the interferogram dimension). These unknowns can be solved using the
least-squares method. An energy cost function that described above can
be written as
\begin{equation}\label{ls_funtional}
  U(a_{x,y},\varphi_{x,y},\psi_{x,y})=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}
  [a_{x,y}+\varphi_{x,y}C_k-\psi_{x,y}S_k-I_{x,y,k}^{'}]^2,
\end{equation}
where $I_{x,y,k}^{'}$ is the $k$-th experimentally measured intensity
of the interferogram sequence. For the known $\alpha_k$, the
least-squares criteria require to make zero the gradient of
Eq. (\ref{ls_funtional}) as
\begin{equation}\label{minimize_U}
  \nabla U(a_{x,y},\varphi_{x,y},\psi_{x,y})=0.
\end{equation}
Eq. (\ref{minimize_U}) yields
\begin{equation}\label{x=AB}
  X = A^{-1} B,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{A}
  A = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c}
      M\times N & \sum C_k     & \sum S_k \\
      \sum C_k  & \sum C_k^2   & \sum C_k S_k \\
      \sum S_k  & \sum S_k C_k & \sum S_k^2\end{array} \right],
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{B}
  B = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c}
      \sum I_{x,y,k}^{'} & \sum I_{x,y,k}^{'} C_k & \sum I_{x,y,k}^{'} S_k \end{array}
  \right]^T,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{X}
  X = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c}
      a_{x,y} & \varphi_{x,y} & \psi_{x,y} \end{array} \right]^T,
\end{equation}
where the sum $\sum$ runs over $k=0,1,2,...,L-1$. To ensure that $A$
is nonsingular, Eq.  (\ref{x=AB}) requires at least three different
phase-steps. From Eqs.  (\ref{A})-(\ref{X}) phase $\phi$ at point
$x,y$ can be determined from
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{x,y} = \arctan(-\psi_{x,y}/\varphi_{x,y}).
\end{equation}
Note that the inverse of A is performed only once because its
components depend only on the $\alpha_k$ steps.

\subsection{Robust self-tuning (RST) method}

    \begin{tabular}{ c c c c c }
      \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{figures/Interferograma.png} }&
    \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{figures/Interferograma2.png}}&

\end{tabular}	
\end{center}
\caption{Interferogram sequence used to test the AIA and the proposed
  algorithm (RST).}
\label{fig:Interferograms}
\end{figure}
To determine the steps, we propose the following regularized cost
functional
\begin{eqnarray} \label{rst_functional} \left
    U(a_{x,y},C_{x,y}^k,S_{x,y}^k) & = & \sum_{x,y} \sum_{k=0}^{L-1}
    \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \sum_{n=-1}^{1}
    \left[a_{x,y}+\varphi_{x+m,y+n}C_{x,y}^k-\psi_{x+m,y+n}S_{x,y}^k-I_{x+m,y+n,k}^{'}
    \right] ^2 \nonumber \\
    & & {} + \sum_{x,y} \sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \left[ \lambda
      \frac{\nabla[a_{x,y}]}{L} + \mu \nabla[C_{x,y}^k] + \mu
      \nabla[S_{x,y}^k] \right] ^2,
  \end{eqnarray}
  where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the regularization parameters that
  control the smoothness of $a_{x,y}$, $C_{x,y}^k$ and
  $S_{x,y}^k$. Operator $\nabla[*]$ takes the first order differences
  along the $x$ and $y$ directions as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla[f_{x,y}] = [a_{x,y}-a_{x-1,y},a_{x,y}-a_{x,y-1}]^T.
  \end{equation}

  To find our unkown steps we need to minimize the cost functional in
  Eq \ref{rst_functional}. Equating the partial gradient with respect
  to $a_{x,y}$, $C_{x,y}^k$ and $S_{x,y}^k$ to zero, and solving, we
  obtain a closed formula for iteratively computing the background
  illumination and the phase-shift steps, as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    a_{x,y} = \frac{ \sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \sum_{n=-1}^{1} \left[\\
	-\varphi_{x+m,y+n}C_{x,y}^k+\psi_{x+m,y+n}S_{x,y}^k+I_{x+m,y+n,k}^{'} \right] \\
      + \lambda R[a_{x,y}] }
    { 9L + N \lambda},
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}\label{C_xy}
    C_{x,y}^k = \frac{ \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \sum_{n=-1}^{1} \left[ -a_{x,y} \varphi_{x+m,y+n}+
	\psi_{x+m,y+n} \varphi_{x+m,y+n} S_{x,y}^k +\\ 		I_{x+m,y+n,k}^{'}
	\varphi_{x+m,y+n} \right] + \mu R[C_{x,y}^k] }
    { \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \sum_{n=-1}^{1} \varphi_{x+m,y+n}^2 + N \mu },
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}\label{S_xy}
    S_{x,y}^k = \frac{ \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \sum_{n=-1}^{1} \left[ a_{x,y} \psi_{x+m,y+n} +
	\psi_{x+m,y+n} \varphi_{x+m,y+n} C_{x,y}^k-I_{x+m,y+n,k}^{'} \psi_{x+m,y+n} \right] 
      + \mu R[C_{x,y}^k]}
    { \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \sum_{n=-1}^{1} \psi_{x+m,y+n}^2 + N \mu},
  \end{equation}
  were $R[a_{x,y}]=a_{x-1,y}+a_{x+1,y}+a_{x,y-1}+a_{x,y+1}$,
  $R[C_{x,y}^k]=C_{x-1,y}^k+C_{x+1,y}^k+C_{x,y-1}+C_{x,y+1}^k$ and
  $R[S_{x,y}^k]=S_{x-1,y}^k+S_{x+1,y}^k+S_{x,y-1}+S_{x,y+1}^k$. As we
  see from Eqs \ref{C_xy} and \ref{S_xy}, we can compute the
  phase-shift in every site of each interferogram. Then, to obtain the
  phase-shift steps, we use
  \begin{equation}
    \alpha_k = \arctan(-S_m^k/C_m^k),
  \end{equation}
  where $S_m^k$ and $C_m^k$ are the mode, the most frequent value,
  calculated for each interferogram. Now, to determine the modulated
  phase, we use the least squares method and the proposed method
  alternately until the values ​​of the phase-shifts converge to a
  desired value.

  using the regularized self-tuning (RST) method proposed here. (b)
  shows the recovered phase and error using the AIA method. The error
  shown (in radians) is the variance with respec to the true phase
  map. The interferogram frames has a size of 512 x 512.}
\label{fig:phase}
\end{figure}

To test the robust self-tuning algorithm developed here, we simulated
$50$ interferogram sequences with different temporal frequencies, and
5 interferograms each sequence. An example of these interferogram
sequences is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Interferograms}. These simulated
interferograms have poor fringe visibility, since we have added
non-constant background illumination and contrast.  To reproduce the
interferogram sequences that we used in these tests, the reader can
use Eq. \ref{I_k1} with the following parameters:
\begin{equation}
  a_{x,y}=-\frac{(x-256)^2+(y-256)^2}{1.5259x10^{-5}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  b_{x,y}=e^{-\frac{(x-256)^2+(y-256)^2}{100^{2}}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{x,y}= 30(-1+\frac{x}{2}-x^5-y^3) e^{(-x^2-y^2)}+\frac{4\pi x}{512}+\frac{4\pi
    y}{512},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_k = k\frac{\pi}{3}+\eta_k,\: k=0,1,..,5,
\end{equation}
where $\eta_k$ is a random number with mean zero and a variance of 0.5
that changes at each step.  In our numerical experiments, we always
start the temporal carrier $\alpha_k=0,1,..,5$.  Regularization
parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ were set at 100 and 500 respectively
(see Eq. \ref{rst_functional}). Using the Gauss-Seidel method to find
the phase-steps (Eqs.  13, 14 and 15) 50 iterations were
required. Finally, to estimate the phase in the AIA and our proposed
method, 20 iterations were required.

In Table. \ref{Tab:step-error} , we show the error values of the
estimated phase-shifts using our regularized method and the estimated
using the AIA method. These errors are calculated as $|\alpha_k -
\hat{ \alpha }_k }|$, where $\alpha_k$ and $\hat{\alpha}_k$ are the
values of the actual and estimated phase-shifts for the $k-$frame,
respectively.  On the other hand, in Fig. \ref{fig:phase} , we show
the recovered phase. Fig.  \ref{fig:phase}(a) shows the recovered
phase using the regularized self-tuning demodulation method presented
here, while Fig. \ref{fig:phase}(b) shows the recovered phase using
the AIA method.  In this figure, we can see in this figure that our
proposed regularized self-tuning demodulation method recovers the
phase with less error than the AIA method. The errors shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:phase}(a) and Fig. \ref{fig:phase}(b) are calculated as
the variance between the recovered phase map and the true phase map
used to generate the interferograms.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline

    actual phase-shift for the AIA and the proposed method, and the phase-shift 
    average error.} 
  \label{Tab:step-error}
\end{table}

On the other hand, Table 2 shows the average error of 50 random tests,
with the same parameters listed above. As seen from these results, the
proposed method recovers the phase with three orders of magnitude less
than the AIA method.  Finally, in Fig 3(b) shows the recovered phase
with the RST method using a 4-frame experimental sequence, while Fig
3(c) shows the recovered phase using the AIA method. As we see in Fig
3(c), the AIA method recovers a phase map with detuning error.  The
interferogram shown in Fig 3(a) is the first frame of the sequence
used. For demonstration purposes, we modify the contrast and
background illumination of the original experimental sequence as
follows: $I_n=a+bI$, where $I_n$ is the new interferogram sequence,
$a$ is a parabola centered at the origin with an amplitude of one, $b$
is a Gaussian with a variance of 7 and I is the original experimental
sequence.

\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a regularized self-tuning phase-shifting
demodulation method for interferogram sequences that have arbitrary
variations of the inter-frame phase-shifts.  This method is robust to
non-constant background illumination and contrast in their fringes. As
shown in the results, our demodulation method is able to recover the
modulating phase and the inter-frame phase-shifts with a minimum
error. The demodulation method presented here provides stable
convergence and accurate phase demodulation with as few as three
interferograms, even when the phase-shifts are completely random.
